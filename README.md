# Learning Typescript, Recoil and Chakra

## Scope

To learn the following technologies;
- Typescript
- Chakra (CSS Framework for React)
- Recoil (Performant state management for React)

## Description

A simple ToDo app that let the user:
- add a new todo
- remove a todo
- toggle a 'completed' flag

## Why this App?

I wanted to learn Typescript and a new State Management tool that I have recently come across (Recoil).
The best way to learn about a new technology is to use it!

## How to run

- Install
```
  npm i
```
- Run
```
  npm start
```
